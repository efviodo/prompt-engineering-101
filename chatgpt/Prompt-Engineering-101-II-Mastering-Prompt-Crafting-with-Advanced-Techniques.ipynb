Essentially Prompt Engineering is an iterative process of designing and optimizing clear and specific prompts for a Large Language Model to ensure that it generates relevant, accurate, and coherent responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we examined three principles for crafting effective prompts. We demonstrated that the models produces better responses when given clear and specific instructions (the first principle) and discussed several tactics for achieving this. We then established that LLMs benefit from computational time and covered some tactics to force models to reason before rushing to a conclusion (the second principle). Ultimately, we investigated the balance between specificity and creativity (the third principle), experimenting with the parameters Temperature and Top P to explore this trade-off.\n",

    "Massive scale LLMs like GPT-3 or PaLM have exhibited an impressive capacity for natural language understanding and proved to be extraordinarily effective in tasks such as extracting information from texts and generating responses in a consistent human style. Even so, LLM demonstrated to be quite robust performing unknown tasks when a few shot examples are included in the prompt. This technique, popularized as few-shot prompting by [Brown et al. (2020)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf), probed to increase model performance on several benchmarks. Not to mention it saves money and time in fine tuning the model to a new specific domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, studies evidenced that models like these abruptly drop their performance on common reasoning tasks or math quizzes. Despite the ability to quote the complete ancient Greek epic poem The Odyssey, these models struggle with school fundamental problems in logic and math.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/7.webp\" alt=\"Principles of Prompt Engineering\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "So what options do we have? Do we send GPT-3 for a season to an elementary school? Fortunately, there is a cheaper and less embarrassing alternative. Can you imagine persuading the principal of your local primary school to accept ChatGPT in the middle of the term?\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to how humans approach complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems and following a logical reasoning line, we can instruct a Language Model to do the same. This approach was explored by Wei J et al. in [Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903). It demonstrated impressive results on several benchmarks, confirming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) as a solid approach to improve LLMs performance on common reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below (taken from Wei J's article), an LLM model rushes to an incorrect conclusion while calculating the number of apples remaining in a cafeteria. This happens even when a similar reasoning problem using tennis balls is provided as part of the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, when a step-by-step process to solve the problem is included into the context (CoT), the model can accurately arrive at a valid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/8.png\" alt=\"Principles of Prompt Engineering\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "With chain of thought prompting, language models of sufficient scale (~100B parameters) can:\n",

    "1. Decompose multi-step problems into intermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems that require more reasoning steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Provide an interpretable window into the behavior of the model, suggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities to debug where the reasoning path went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extend the application field to math word problems, common sense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method can be used providing reasoning examples to the model (few-shot) or no example (zero-shot). Let's see both flavors in practice with a real application example."

By adopting this strategy, we initially guide the model towards logical reasoning outputs, enabling the model to base its responses on similar problems encountered during training. Secondly, we assist the model by requesting it to break down larger problems into smaller, manageable ones. The model is then required to produce coherent results for simple sub-problems, such as identifying prices and the number of bars in each package, calculating the unit price, and finally, performing comparisons. Furthermore, because of how auto-regressive language models like GPT-3 or GPT-4 generate sequences token by token, where each new token is generated based on all the previously generated tokens, the chain-of-thought itself has a strong positive influence in the generation of a final coherent result.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are some scenarios where LLM fails to generate consistent responses, even using CoT and for the same prompt, it is possible for the model to get confused between executions and return an inconsistent response. In this context, [Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171) is a simple but effective approach, consisting of simply asking the model with the same prompt multiple times and taking the majority result as the final answer. Combining this technique with CoT helps to obtain more robust and predictable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, let's consider the example of apples in the cafeteria presented on the Chain-of-Thought paper. Instead of just calling the model once with the input prompt, we can call the model three times and take the majority answer as the final answer (see image below).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/10.png\" alt=\"Principles of Prompt Engineering\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "By adopting the majority's response, the likelihood of the model returning an incorrect output during a specific execution is significantly reduced. The effect of this technique is enhanced by increasing repetition. However, repeated execution of the prompt indicates a higher number of calls to the model, leading to greater hardware consumption. In the case of large language models like GPT-3, this also translates to more API calls and consequently, more money spent, all for generating a single answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our Prompt Engineering journey does not end at CoT+Self-Consistency (despite the excellent performance). Luckily for this writer, there are much more aspects of Prompt Engineering to learn before mastering this art. Below, I explore a few complementary factors to consider when writing prompts and introduce three useful tools that you can use to write effective prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1- Choose the right delimiter**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the eyes of an LLM, not all delimiters are equal. As a general rule, it is convenient to use separators that, in addition to being infrequent characters to find in the rest of the input (avoiding confusing the model with the prompt), are represented by only 1 token. In this way we reduce the consumption of tokens in the prompt, saving hardware resources, money and allowing us to use that token for something else more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use [OpenAI Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to double-check if your delimiters are represented by a single Token.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Triple quotes `“““` → 1 Token\n",
    "* Triple back-ticks  \\`\\`\\` → 2 Tokens\n",
    "* Triple dashes `---` → 1 Token\n",
    "* Triple Sharps `###` → 1 Token\n",
    "* Angle brackets `< >` → 2 Tokens\n",
    "* XML tags `<tag></tag>` → 5 Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2- Pre-process your inputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than passing user input to the model as part of the prompt, it is recommended to pre-process this input using string methods, regular expressions, or similar tools. The aim is to remove unnecessary spaces, punctuation, HTML tags, and other superfluous elements that might hinder the model's understanding or task completion. This approach not only economizes on tokens, thus reducing costs on models like ChatGPT, which charge per token, but it also aids in identifying prompt injections, privacy concerns, and related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3- Prompt Perfect**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can craft effective prompts from scratch by following specific principles and techniques (like the ones introduced in this post series). However, an even better approach is to utilize a prompt optimizer such as [PromptPerfect](https://promptperfect.jina.ai/). This tool leverages AI to enhance your custom prompts based on the specific target model you are using (GPT-3, GPT-4, Midjourney, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can't afford incorporating these tools as part of your application design, consider at least exploring them. Several tips can be learned from optimized examples available on documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4- Prompt Templates**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of reinventing the wheel, read prompt templates shared by people across the Internet. If none prompt fits your needs, at least you can take ideas. Here are two sites from which you can pull various prompt templates for ChatGPT, Midjourney and the most popular models:\n",

    "This posts series is inspired by the outstanding courses of [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/) and [Isabella Fulford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabella-fulford/) and the excellent LLM Bootcamp provided by [Charles Frye](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-frye-38654abb/), [Sergey Karayev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeykarayev/), and [Josh Tobin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-tobin-4b3b10a9/) (both courses are mentioned in the resources section). After completing these learning programs, I was eager to delve deeper, exploring academic papers and tutorials. This led me on a journey through the Internet, discerning high-quality resources from junk. I even ordered two books from Amazon on Prompt Engineering and Generative AI for Artwork, which turned out to be poorly written and a complete waste of money. After several weeks of intense work, headaches and cups of coffee, I found myself with a collection of resources of great value about Prompt Engineering. In the spirit of helping others in their Prompt Engineering journey, I decided to share my experience writing this series of posts.\n",
